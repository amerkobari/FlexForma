                Keep your back straight, chest up, and shoulders back.<br>
                Initiate the squat by bending at your hips and knees, pushing your hips back and lowering your body toward the ground.<br>

                Engage your glutes and core as you push through your heels to return to the starting position.<br>

                Lower your body toward the ground by bending both knees.<br>
                The back knee should hover just above the floor, forming two 90-degree angles with your front and back legs.<br>

                Keep your core engaged and chest up throughout the movement.<br>

                Unrack the weight by disengaging the safety mechanism.<br>
                Lower the footplate by bending your knees until they form a 90-degree angle.<br>
