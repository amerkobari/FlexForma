                <h3>Pullover:</h3>Lie on your back on a flat bench, feet planted on the floor.<br>
                Hold a dumbbell with both hands, palms pressed against the underside of one of the sides of the weight.<br>
                Extend your arms overhead, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.<br>
                Lower the dumbbell backward in an arc motion, feeling a stretch in your chest and lats.<br>
                Once your arms are parallel to the floor or slightly lower, reverse the motion and pull the dumbbell back up using your chest and lats.<br>
                Lower the dumbbell back to the starting position in a controlled manner.

                Hang from a pull-up bar with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.<br>
                Keep your arms fully extended, and your body in a straight line.<br>
                Engage your back muscles, particularly your lats, and pull your chest toward the bar.<br>
                Focus on bringing your elbows down and back, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.<br>
                Lower your body back down with control, fully extending your arms.<br>
                Maintain tension in your back muscles throughout the descent.<br>

                Adjust the leg curl machine to your body size.<br>
                Lie face down on the machine with your knees just beyond the edge of the bench and your ankles hooked under the padded lever.<br>
                Grab the handles or hold onto the bench for stability.<br>
                Curl your legs upward, bringing the padded lever towards your glutes by flexing your knees.<br>
                Hold the fully contracted position for a moment, engaging your hamstrings.<br>
                Slowly lower the padded lever back to the starting position, straightening your legs.

                Allow your arms to hang straight with your palms facing your body.<br>
                Elevate your shoulders as high as possible toward your ears.<br>
                Focus on using your upper trapezius muscles to lift the dumbbells, avoiding excessive movement in other parts of your body.<br>
                Hold the shrug position at the top for a brief moment, contracting your upper traps.<br>
                Lower your shoulders back down in a controlled manner, returning to the starting position.

                Sit on a lat pulldown machine with your knees securely positioned under the leg pads.<br>
                Grasp the bar with a wide, overhand grip, hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.<br>
                Ensure your back is straight, chest up, and shoulders relaxed.<br>
                Pull the bar down towards your chest by engaging your lat muscles.<br>
                Focus on bringing your elbows down and back, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the bottom of the movement.<br>
                Slowly release the bar back to the starting position, allowing your arms to fully extend.
                Maintain control throughout the entire range of motion.

                Pull the weight(s) toward your lower chest or upper abdomen by retracting your shoulder blades and bending your elbows.<br>
                Keep your elbows close to your body and squeeze your back muscles at the top of the movement.<br>
               Lower the weight(s) back down in a controlled manner, fully extending your arms.<br>
                Maintain a stable, neutral spine throughout the exercise.
